# toDoList
Todo List challenge from Web Dev Bootcamp (no assistance)

Task was to supply to user with a simple browser/console interface to add, list, or delete items from a todo list.  Project was not intended to look good or have a nice interface.  Just showcasing my ability to transfer programming knowledge from one language to another.
